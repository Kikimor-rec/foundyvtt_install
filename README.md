WARNING: Use at your own peril
The recommended and official method for installing FoundryVTT can be found here. You can also view a slightly more in depth version from the community wiki here

##This script should make it very easy to install Foundry VTT on any VPS server with a Debian system.

This is an attempt to improve the original script 
https://github.com/grapeofwrath/foundryvtt-install-with-caddy-pm2

In fact, at the moment the current script runs the installation of all necessary dependencies and packages, and instead of inserting a link to the foundry archive it offers to insert the link during the installation process.

It also creates the necessary folders for the user and grants rights to them for the foundry user.

I am not a very experienced system administrator.
If you see how the script can be improved or optimised - please let me know.t_install
